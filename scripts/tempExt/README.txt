Content templates here are specifically meant for other mods, that is, some mechanics are stripped off for better compatibility with mods.
Actually you can use Lovec templates under "scripts/temp", but the contents can be affected by those mechanics which may be unwanted in your mods. If you need external version of some template, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub.
See LovecLab or ProjReind for examples on how to create contents with templates.
