# Lovecraftian Library

A **JavaScript** library for my other mods, containing utility methods and all the content templates. The library does not add any new contents, but can serve as a QOL mod with its features like damage display, recipe searching, etc.

Lovec is based on my previous mod [Reindustrialization](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Reindustrialization), which has been archived separated into several mods now. Also see [LovecLab](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Laboratory) and [ProjReind](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Project-Reindustrialization) where actual contents are created.
