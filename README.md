# Lovecraftian Library

Lovec is a JavaScript library mod that I made mostly for my other mods, it alone does not add any new contents, and can be used as a QOL mod for recipe searching, damage display, etc. The mod structure is very different from most JS mods.

The mod is based on my previous mod [Reindustrialization](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Reindustrialization), which has been separated into several mods now. See [LovecLab](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Laboratory) and [ProjReind](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Project-Reindustrialization).

If you have any ideas for new mechanics or want to report bugs, you can submit an issue here or DM me on Discord (maboroshix). Forum on Discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/1346118807734845440).
